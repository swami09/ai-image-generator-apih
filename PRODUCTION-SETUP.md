# Production Setup Guide

## Quick Start for Marketplace Release

### 1. Build and Start Production Server
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
The application will run on port 5000 (or PORT environment variable) in production mode.

### 2. Environment Variables Required
- `NODE_ENV=production` (set automatically by npm start)
- `DATABASE_URL` (optional - uses in-memory storage if not provided)
- `PORT` (optional - defaults to 5000)

### 3. Security Features âœ…
- âœ… Safe header whitelisting in proxy (no sensitive data leakage)
- âœ… bcrypt password hashing (12 salt rounds)
- âœ… Admin endpoints disabled in production (load-balancer/stats, debug/env)
- âœ… Environment-based routing (static files in production)

### 4. Core Features Working âœ…
- âœ… User authentication (signup/login/profile)
- âœ… Image generation with load balancer + fallback
- âœ… Health monitoring with proper environment reporting
- âœ… API documentation and model endpoints
- âœ… 9-endpoint load balancer with pollination scraper fallback

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Simple Express Server (Recommended)
Just run `npm start` - the built application serves both API and frontend on port 5000.

### Option 2: Cloudflare Workers (Advanced)
1. Update domains in `wrangler.toml` (replace `yourdomain.com`)
2. Set API tokens as environment variables (don't hardcode)
3. Run: `npx wrangler deploy --env production`
